# Space

A configurable dashboard for all the space nerds. It saves your config in localStorage.

## Available widgets

- ISS live feed (outside)
- ISS live feed (inside)
- ISS location map
- NASA+ TV
- Launch streams (if I'm awake enough to upload them)
- Text-only launch commentary (NASA should have something for their launches, accessibility requirement due to being a gov agency maybe, hopefully?)
